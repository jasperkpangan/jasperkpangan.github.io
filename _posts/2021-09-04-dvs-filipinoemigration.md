*This is our final project for our Data Visualization and Storytelling class. This was created alongside [Jelo Delariarte](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jelodelariarte/), [Sasha Garcia](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sharmaineselenegarcia/), [Leo Lorenzo](https://www.linkedin.com/in/leolorenzoii/), and [Hezi Rance](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hezirance/). We were tasked to present a data visualization using any dataset of our choice.*


## Executive Summary
Filipinos have established a global community in an increasingly globalized world.  The numbers and demographics show that young Filipinas are most likely to be found studying in the USA, Canada, and Japan. However, these also show that they are not alone, as they bring with them their families to these new lands, bringing their heritage beyond the country's borders. These families then continue to build on this global community, spread the familial culture, and enable how the World Meets Pinoys.

## Recommendation
For policy makers, we recommend to: 
- strengthen the Balikbayan Program to attract more Filipino emigrants to return to the Philippines

For future studies on emigration of Filipinos, we recommend to: 
- use more granular data for place of origin (e.g. province or municipality) and occupation may lead to a more relevant and insightful results
- sompare the counts to the population in the Philippines to obtain relative percentages of Filipinos emigrating over the years versus the total population.

*This project was created using Tableau (for the individual charts and final visualization), Python (for data processing), and [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/) (for the style of the map layout). To create the visualization of the emigration flow in a map, you may follow this [tutorial](https://www.tableau.com/about/blog/2018/8/flights-world-part-ii-how-map-great-circle-routes-newest-tableau-release-92811) by Tableau. The dataset was downloaded from the Freedom of Information [website](https://www.foi.gov.ph/).*
