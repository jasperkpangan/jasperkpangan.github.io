Hello and welcome!

Iâ€™m Jasper, a data scientist originally from the Philippines, currently based in Estonia. I have a Masterâ€™s degree in Data Science and am deeply passionate about uncovering meaningful insights through data visualization, particularly in geospatial data and machine learning.

This website is a space where I showcase my projects, interests, and the work that excites me. Iâ€™m constantly exploring new ways to analyze and present data, and Iâ€™m eager to share these findings with you. If youâ€™re curious about any of the projects Iâ€™ve shared, interested in collaborating, or just want to connect, feel free to reach out to me at <jasperkpangan@gmail.com>.

Iâ€™m still in the process of building up this site, so if you spot any errors or have any suggestions, Iâ€™d love to hear from you. Iâ€™m also working on uploading several new projects, including:

- Exploratory Data Analysis of Restaurants in Makati City: Using data mining and wrangling techniques.
- Analyzing and Clustering US 2020 Election Tweets: Leveraging natural language processing and Mini-batch K-Means.

Stay tuned for these and more!

When Iâ€™m not diving into data, I enjoy traveling and playing computer games. Thanks for stopping by, and I hope you find something here that sparks your interest! ðŸ˜Š
