Hi! Thank you for visiting my website. I created this to share and showcase my projects, interests, and passion. If you are curious about any of the projects I shared, if you want to collaborate, or if you simply want to connect, feel free to e-mail me at <jasperkpangan@gmail.com>. 

I am still building up this site so if you see any corrections or errors, please do e-mail me. Also, here's a line-up of other projects I have yet to upload:
- exploratory data analysis of restaurants in Makati City using data mining and wranling techniques,
- analyzing and clustering US 2020 election tweets using natural language processing and Mini-batch $k$-Means,
and many more, so stay tuned! ðŸ˜Š
